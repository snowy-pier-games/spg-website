# spg-website
Website for Snowy Pier Games LLC. This is an ASP.NET Core Web Application, with an Angular frontend and a C# backend packaged together in the same solution.

### Prerequisities
* [Visual Studio (at least 2015)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* Visual Studio ASP.NET and web development tools (or at least TypeScript and an IIS Express server)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Building locally
##### Windows
Simply load the solution (spg-website.sln) into Visual Studio and then build it. The first time you build, it might take awhile due to npm restoring all of the required node modules for the frontend.

##### Linux (or without Visual Studio)

### Running locally
##### Windows
Simply run from Visual Studio, which will start up the IIS Express server and open a browser to localhost:<port>.
